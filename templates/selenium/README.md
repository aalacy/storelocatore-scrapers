# How to write a JavaScript scraper for SafeGraph using Apify and Selenium

Please write your code inside scrape.js at the `// Replace this with your actual scrape` comment. 

Note that to use Selenium locally, you'll need to have the ChromeDriver in your path: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/

Documentation on `launchWebDriver`: https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/apify#module_Apify.launchWebDriver

Executing `apify run` should create an apify_storage directory with json objects for all of the POI you scraped. If you don't have the apify CLI, running `npm install` should install it. Documentation for the CLI is here: https://github.com/apifytech/apify-cli
