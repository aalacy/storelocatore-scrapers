To run tests:

`python setup.py test`

After a change is made, just run*: 

`pip install validator/`

Make sure you've activated a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), 
or else this package will be installed globally.

*You may need to run this in sudo.
