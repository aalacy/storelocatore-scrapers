# Custom JavaScript scraper

Please write your code inside scrape.js in the `scrape()` function. The `scrape()` function should return an array of json objects. Each json object should be one of the POI you scraped from the page.

Executing `apify run` should create an apify_storage directory with json objects for all of the POI you scraped.

If you don't have the apify CLI, running `npm install` should install it. Documentation for the CLI is here: https://github.com/apifytech/apify-cli
