Not passing validation because:
1. "Invalid Canadian Postal Codes" in data (being scraped correctly, just not passing)
2. Bass pro shops tend to be on custom road, e.g. 1 Bass Pro Dr. The lat, long duplication validator
only looks at street address to determine duplication, so it thinks these are the same address with 
multiple lat, long, when actually the streets are in different cities.
