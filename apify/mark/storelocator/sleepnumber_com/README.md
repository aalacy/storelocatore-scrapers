Scraper was originally tested with max concurrency 10. When max concurrency was high, it seemed to cause an ERR not error as some files would suddenly be deleted from the request queue. According to Apify, it might be some type of race condition but I'm not exactly sure. Sometimes the site would suddenly stop loading and pages would then throw error in succession so there might be some type of rate limiting applied as well.
