# How to write a JavaScript scraper for SafeGraph using Apify and Puppeteer

Please write your code inside scrape.js at the `// Replace this with your actual scrape` comment. Any URL passed to `requestQueue.addRequest` will be processed by your `handlePageFunction`.

Documentation on the PuppeteerCrawler: https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/puppeteercrawler

Executing `apify run` should create an apify_storage directory with json objects for all of the POI you scraped. If you don't have the apify CLI, running `npm install` should install it. Documentation for the CLI is here: https://github.com/apifytech/apify-cli
