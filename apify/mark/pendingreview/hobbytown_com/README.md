Received one error from validator:

Found 1 rows with inconsistent geographies. Look at the REASON column in the output below to see why these rows were flagged. Examples:
            location_name  ...                REASON
109  HobbyTown Southfield  ...  ZIPCODE_NOT_IN_STATE

[1 rows x 8 columns]

The location is providing this zip code, seems to be an error with what the site is providing.
