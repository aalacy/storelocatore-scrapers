The data on this website is incredibly inconsistent.

1. While I tried to get data from the legacy website and cross refence it with the main website, there was no unique identifier among the two, so I couldn't combine the datasets programatically.

2. There are individual page URL's on the main website that can be grabbed from this URL: https://www.webster.edu/_resources/dmc/php/locations.php?datasource=locations&type=listing&returntype=json&xpath=items%2Fitem&items_per_page=100&page=1&search_phrase=&isinternational%5B%5D=United%20States

But, as in the other case, there is not unique identifier from that call that I can combine with where I am currently getting the data to match the page_urls to the main dataset.

3. Overall, some location names will be altered across the site making grabbing the data from one area and cross-referencing it to another area very difficult.
