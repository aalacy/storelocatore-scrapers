Because of the inconsistent form of the address line, it is quite difficult to reliably parse
only the street address portion.
example forms of address:
"317-7th Ave Sw Calgary, Ab Calgary, Alberta T2P2Y9"
"737 Dunsmuir St Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y 1E4"
"Vancouver International Airport 3211 Grant Mcconachie Way Richmond, Bc V7b 0a4 Richmond, British Columbia V7B1Y7"
"3401 Dufferin St Unit 163 A Toronto, Ontario M6A 2T9"
"7014-590 East Camelback Road Scottsdale, Arizona 85251"
"5015 Westheimer Road, Suite 2162 Houston, Texas 77056"
"909, North Michigan Avenue  Chicago, Illinois 60611"

As you can see, it is not trivial to write a parser to handle all these different forms and possibly more.
In keeping with the specs, therefore, the whole thing has been placed in raw_address field.
