Data contains malformed/invalid zip codes so validation is not passing:
            Invalid zip code: 2116
            Invalid zip code: 7078
            Invalid zip code: 7631
            Invalid Canadian postal code: V7B1Y7
            Invalid Canadian postal code: L5P1B2
            Invalid Canadian postal code: M5R1C4
            Invalid Canadian postal code: L5P1B2
            Invalid Canadian postal code: H3G1Z7
            Invalid Canadian postal code: L4L5X5
            Invalid Canadian postal code: T2P2Y9

Also, failing POI counts because the number in the validator truthset is way off. Says there are only 24, when there are in fact 86.
