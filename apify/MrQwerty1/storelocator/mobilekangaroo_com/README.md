## RND:

Complex project. Need `3m` to get `35` projects. Have to use selenium.
I researched a lot to get data from API `/msearch`. There `lat`, `lng` and `original phone` is present but can't recover it. These 3 fields are missing in html. In html there is a static phone. I pulled that one.

### MISSING FIELDS:

- location_type

### INACCESSIBLE FIELDS:
- latitude
- longitude
