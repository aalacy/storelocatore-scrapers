This website have a lot of in-consistent data, specially contact_numbers. And street address.
I have skipped Street_address validation,(python3 validate.py data.csv --ignore StreetAddressHasNumber StreetAddressHasStateName
) but contact number validation is not ignore-able.

due to data in-consistency i am not able to pick right format for these two values, thats why i have put "raw_address" field, with street address+
city+contact_number.
