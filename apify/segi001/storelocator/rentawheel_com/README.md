# Scraper for SLC-6272

I've skipped the following validator checks:
--ignore StreetAddressHasNumber
--ignore CountryValidator
--ignore StoreNumberColumnValidator
for the following reasons:
-- Because some of the data are the stores that are coming soon, so the data for street adress, store number and country are missing or not valid.
