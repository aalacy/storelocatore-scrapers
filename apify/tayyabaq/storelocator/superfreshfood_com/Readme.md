Had to ignore this due to bad record for these two location:
      zip state                REASON  rowNumber
14  11011    NY  ZIPCODE_NOT_IN_STATE         14
22  11472    NY  ZIPCODE_NOT_IN_STATE         22

This record is coming from site itself, and site has these zipcodes for these two locations: Floral Park
 and Queens Village respectively.
