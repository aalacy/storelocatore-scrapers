There are some potential issues when running the validate.py

# All data is parsed from API response. And there are 2 different stores in the same location. So I ignored geo location check and street address check.

"CO-Colorado Springs-Furniture Row", "CO-Colorado Springs-Furniture Row Shopping Center"

--ignore StreetAddressHasNumber --ignore LatLngDuplicationValidator
