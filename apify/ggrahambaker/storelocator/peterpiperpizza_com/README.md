# How to write a Python3 + Selenium scraper for SafeGraph

Please write your scraper such that running `scrape.py` produces a file `data.csv` containing the scraped data.

You can write your scraper between the `#Begin scraper` and `#End scraper` comments in `scrape.py`

Remember to update `requirements.txt` with all dependencies needed to run your scraper. 
Please make sure that:
* Your scraper can be run successfully by executing https://github.com/SafeGraphInc/crawl-service/blob/master/scripts/run_scraper.sh 
* The resulting output passes https://github.com/SafeGraphInc/crawl-service/blob/master/scripts/validate.py
