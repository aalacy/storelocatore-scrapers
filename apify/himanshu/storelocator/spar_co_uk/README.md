### Extra Fields:
`raw_address` 
  - __Motivation__: due to the difficulty of parsing the addresses directly from the data, we're passing them downstream.
  - __Format__: `(raw contact us fields, dictionary with partial address fields)` 

### Validation caveats
`--ignore CountryCodeFillRateChecker` - validator fails to parse British addresses.
