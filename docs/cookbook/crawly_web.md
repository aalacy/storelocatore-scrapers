# Crawly Web Templating Engine

* We made a live, realtime web templating engine to generate tailormade crawl templates.
* It is still very experimental, and we would appreciate all feedback in the `#sg-crawlers-external` channel.

### Instructions:
1. In your browser, open the file: `<crawl-service-home>/templates/crawly-web/index.html`
1. Customize your template using the `Crawler Configuration` section.
1. Copy the files into your own crawl folder using the embedded `(copy)` buttons in the top-right corner of the code snippets.
1. Fill in the blanks and change the auto-generated code however you need.
1. Profit.

* _Tested to work in Chrome and Firefox on Linux_
